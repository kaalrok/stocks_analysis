# Green Stocks Analysis

# Overview of Project
## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to automate the analysis of the Green Stocks that Steve is looking at for investments

## Background
Steve is familiar with using Excel to analyze and chart for stocks and investments. But he realizes that it would take a great deal of time to sort through all the stocks. He asked me to check into creating an analysis using VBA, and then perhaps refracturing the original VBA code we created for him, on the basis of time. 

## Results
We found that using VBA was a huge asset in the initial analysis of the Green Stocks.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of refracturing code
The refractured code is generally more organized and can be faster to run, but it wont do anything more than speed up the time of the compiled code. The disadvantages of refracturing code is that you are adding more code into the original, and may end up causing frustrations with errors. 

Unless the code is very long or the process of working through the code is very long, it is not worth the time and effort of refracturing the code. 

There may be one circumstance where it could still be... if working on the floor of a stock market, and a fraction of a second could cost millions. 


## Advantages and Disadvantages of the scripts
The automation of a script is very nice to use in a situation where one might perform the same task multiple times a day, but it is limited to the user in the sense that it is unchangeable for someone that does not know how to edit it to work a different direction or task. 

## Summary
In refracturing this code, the time saved was milliseconds. Our team is not sure if this will make a real difference to Steve for his current project. But the code is well organized with annotations. 

The original code (and as an extension, the refractured code) will save Steve hours of time not just with the stocks that were listed, but also with any other group of 12 stocks that he might, in the future, be interested in for investments.
